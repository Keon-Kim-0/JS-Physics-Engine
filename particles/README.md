# Physics.js<br/>

## Overview

-Front end library for creative UI. <br/>

-Combines the functionality of Matter.js, with particle.js. <br/>

-No use of libraries for better modularization and new algorithms with better time/space complexity.just pure javascript, and no dependencies. <br/>

- better performence over Matter.js
- better flexibility with shape, lines, and colors/gradience of particles. <br/>

-Customizable laws of physics and structure including:

- gravity <br/>
- weight/density <br/>
- terminl velocity <br/>
- flexibility <br/>
- amount of external force <br/>
- momentum <br/>

## How to use

1.  target file is "physics.js"
2.  there is a straight forward and easy explanation commented in the file(physics.js)
3.  repo linked below contains very simple example of front-end using this library. it is the same repo you see in the demo!
4.  download it and try yourself!
5.  please leave a star if you like my work, I've put in a lot of work, and it means lot to me!
