# Physics.js





-Front end library for creative UI.
-Combines the functionality of Matter.js, with particle.js. 
-No use of libraries for better modularization and new algorithms with better time/space complexity.just pure javascript, and no dependencies.
   - better performence over Matter.js
   - better flexibility with shape, lines, and colors of particles
-Customizable laws of physics and structure including:
   -gravity
   -weight/density
   -terminl velocity
   -flexibility
   -amount of external force
   -momentum
